I evaluated the motion detection capabilities of D-Link DCS-936L and DCS-2670 network cameras in outdoor settings. While nice in principle, fog, snow or wind cause almost permanent false positives. PIR motion sensors solve this issue by only detecing motion of warm objects. I used the sensors from Tinkerforge, which relay the motion detection signal by TCP/IP. 
I wanted to record video by RTSP triggered by the PIR motion detector. But both cameras have a delay of at least 3 seconds before recording starts. So it is not very useful because whatever moved may already have left by then. The solution is to use MJPEG recording, which starts almost immediately. Audio is streamed by RTSP separately. The delay for RTSP audio is not as noticable as for video, because it is inherent to the h264 implementation of these cameras. 

This python program performs motion detections sensor triggered capture and combination of MJPEG video and audio from D-Link network cameras, as well as notification by the xmpp instant messaging protocol. I tested with ejabberd running on the same machine. It combines and converts MJPEG video and AAC audio to the ogg vorbis/theora format using ffmpeg and uploads it to a separate webserver by rsync.
